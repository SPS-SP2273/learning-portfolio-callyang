    "1. A Git repository is a place to store code, files, and the history of changes made to the files. It tracks changes (GitHub desktop app) and allows us to commit (take a snapshot) code. It also allows for files to be shared with others in an accessible manner through the links.\n",
    "2. Git keeps track of changes made in the files in our repository\n",
    "3. A commit is a snapshot of the code made in the files in GitHub at a particular point in time.\n",
    "4. A push is when changes that are made locally and committed is applied to the version of the files on GitHub webpage and saved in the repository on GitHub.\n",

    "6. GitHub Desktop is an app that tracks changes to the files that happen locally in the user's machine (eg. my computer), and allows users to commit, while GitHub is the broader term which can also include the webpage, which also allows the user to make changes to the file and commit to it, but it is separate from the version locally on the machine.
